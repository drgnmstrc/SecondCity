	desc = "The Camarilla's propaganda machine did a good job with you. Even after your character's Embrace, they refused to believe they are a vampire. They remain convinced there must be some logical explanation for their condition, and spend as much time as possible justifying it. You must make a willpower roll whenever feeding and each time you draw a bloodpoint from your victim. When you fail, your character faints for five seconds while also losing a point in their Humanity. You are expected to roleplay this flaw - such as insisting on eating regular food and not feeding."
